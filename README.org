A library for Conformal Classification, Object Detection and Segmentation, based on PyTorch, with all the latest methods and models!
* Introduction
** What is Conformal Prediction?
Conformal prediction is a framework in machine learning that provides a way to quantify the uncertainty of predictions. 
It goes beyond traditional point predictions by providing a set of possible outcomes along with confidence levels. 
This allows for more reliable and interpretable predictions, especially in situations where the training data is limited or noisy. 
Conformal prediction can be applied to various tasks, including classification, regression, object detection, and segmentation.
** What is CODS and why? 
CODS is a vision-oriented python library that implements conformal prediction for classification, object detection and (soon) segmentation.
It is built on top of PyTorch for efficiency (with CUDA support), and is designed to allow for easy addition of new conformal scores, procedures, models or dataset, and for quick benchmarking of those.
